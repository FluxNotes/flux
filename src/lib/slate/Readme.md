This directory contains the core logic of Slate. It's separated further into a series of directories:

- [**Components**](./components) — containing the React components Slate renders.
- [**Constants**](./constants) — containing constants that are used in Slate's codebase.
- [**Models**](./models) — containing the models that define Slate's internal data structure.
- [**Plugins**](./plugins) — containing the plugins that ship with Slate by default.
- [**Schemas**](./schemas) - containing the schemas that ship with Slate by default.
- [**Serializers**](./serializers) — containing the serializers that ship with Slate by default.
- [**Transforms**](./transforms) — containing the transforms that are used to alter a Slate document.
- [**Utils**](./utils) — containing a few private convenience modules.

Feel free to poke around in each of them to learn more!
